# format = BAMPE
# ChIP-seq file = ['test/analysis/atac/bams/lib002_filt.bam']
# control file = None
# effective genome size = 1.87e+09
# band width = 300
# model fold = [5, 50]
# pvalue cutoff = 1.00e-02
# qvalue will not be calculated and reported as -1 in the final output.
# The maximum gap between significant sites is assigned as the read length/tag size.
# The minimum length of peaks is assigned as the predicted fragment length "d".
# Larger dataset will be scaled towards smaller dataset.
# Range for calculating regional lambda is: 10000 bps
# Broad region calling is off
# Paired-End mode is on

# fragment size is determined as 202 bps
# total fragments in treatment: 8236
# d = 202
# local lambda is disabled!
