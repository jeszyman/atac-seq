# The maximum gap between significant sites is assigned as the read length/tag size.
# The minimum length of peaks is assigned as the predicted fragment length "d".
# Larger dataset will be scaled towards smaller dataset.
# Range for calculating regional lambda is: 10000 bps
# Broad region calling is on
# Paired-End mode is on
# MACS will save fragment pileup signal per million reads

# fragment size is determined as 155 bps
# total fragments in treatment: 8174
# d = 155
